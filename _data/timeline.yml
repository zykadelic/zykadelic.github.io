  - After the internship within The Company P, the development team of the company migrated to Qubator. This coincided with my high school graduation, and Qubator quickly decided to take me in to their core team as a full-time developer.
  - My main areas have been front end development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery) and back end development (Ruby on Rails and digging deeper down the Rails framework), though further interaction design, application design, project management and working with clients have been common.
