Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m building things on the Internet since 2009.

So far Iâ€™ve been speccing into a fairly vanilla front end stack (*HTML5*, *CSS3/[Sass](https://sass-lang.com)*, *JavaScript/jQuery*), the more hipster back end web app framework *[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)*, and some human-computer interaction design ([UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience)). Iâ€™m recently interested in *[React](https://reactjs.org)* and *[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)*.

I have learned both from my own practice, and through working side by side with some amazing mentors since high school. I enjoy smaller multi-disciplinary teams, and have mostly been in startup settings where Iâ€™ve learned to play many different roles at once (from system architect to designer and project manager), but maining as a web developer.

In addition to the previous, Iâ€™ve been working with *MySQL/PostgreSQL*, *[Redis](https://redis.io)*, *[Git](https://git-scm.com)*, using and writing a variety of *REST APIs*, basic server hosting on *Ubuntu* with *[Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)* and *[Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)*, and deploying web apps with *[Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com)*.
