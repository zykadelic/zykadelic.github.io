Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m building things on the Internet since 2009.

I have mainly taken a deep-dive into vanilla front end technologies (such as *HTML5*, *CSS3/[Sass](https://sass-lang.com)*, *JavaScript/jQuery*), and the back end web framework *[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)*.

Iâ€™ve learned both on my own accord and through working side by side with some incredible mentors. Most of my time has been with small companies and startups, meaning Iâ€™ve learned to wear many different kinds of hats at once; anything from design to project management.

Besides the previously mentioned technologies, Iâ€™ve been using *MySQL/PostgreSQL*, *[Redis](https://redis.io)*, *[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)*, *[Git](https://git-scm.com)*, a wide variety of *REST APIs* (including a couple of my own), as well as basic hosting and deployment on *Ubuntu* with *[Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)*, *[Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)*, and *[Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com)*.

My latest interests are the *[React](https://reactjs.org)* framework and digging deeper into product design.
